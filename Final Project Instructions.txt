Final Project Instructions
Folder Name: Final Project

Create the Main Folder:

First, create a folder on your computer and name it Final Project. This is where all your files for the project will go.
Create Subfolders:

Inside the Final Project folder, create two new folders:
assets: This folder will hold all the images you want to use in your project.
css: This folder will store your CSS files.
Organize Your Files:

For each HTML file (like index.html, portfolio.html, etc.), you will create a separate CSS file with the same name but with a .css extension. For example:
index.html will use a CSS file called index.css.
portfolio.html will use a CSS file called portfolio.css.
Place all your CSS files in the css folder.
Store any images you want to use in your project inside the assets folder.
Link Your CSS Files:

In each of your HTML files, make sure to link to the correct CSS file from the css folder. For example, in index.html, you would link to css/index.css like this:
html
Copy code
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/index.css">
Final Structure:

Your project should look like this:
scss
Copy code
